# Front-end Setup

First, get NodeJS (JavaScript runtime) -
Then, install yarn (JS package manager) -
Finally, install the dependencies by running this command in the frontend/ folder: `yarn`

If you run into any problems up until now, try Googling -- it's probably something with yoursystem, as everything we use is cross-platform and popular.

Now, start the site -- `yarn dev`

In `components/constants.js` you can modify the backend server URL and webhost to point to your local servers. Ideally, it will work out of the box without any configuration on your part. Your web server should be `localhost:3000` and your Java server should be `localhost:8080`
